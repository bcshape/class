# Key Spring 2026 calendar notes (BC)

- **Classes begin:** Mon **Jan 12, 2026**  
- **MLK Day (no classes):** Mon **Jan 19, 2026**  
- **Spring recess (no classes):** Mon–Fri **Mar 2–6, 2026**  
- **Easter recess (no classes):** Thu–Mon **Apr 2–6, 2026** (classes resume **Apr 6 at 4pm**)  
- **Patriot’s Day (no classes):** Mon **Apr 20, 2026**  
- **Spring Half-Term 2 ends:** Thu **Apr 30, 2026**  
- **Study days / exam period:** see the Registrar’s final exam schedule for your section.

(These items are intentionally high-level—your individual meeting pattern determines which specific “no class” dates affect you.)

# Phase I: Core toolkit (Weeks 1–8)

## Week 1 (Jan 12): What is “shape,” and how do we measure it reproducibly?

**Topics**
- Shape vs size; biological meaning of “shape”
- Reproducible workflows (R projects, `here()`, R Markdown, Git/GitHub)
- First biological case study: ecomorphology in fishes (or sharks)

**Deliverable:** AME 1 — repo setup + 1 figure + short interpretation

---

## Week 2 (Jan 19): Univariate characters (and why they still matter)
> **MLK Day:** if your section meets on Monday, this is an async lab week.

**Topics**
- Trait definition, scaling, ratios, allometry
- Measurement error and repeatability
- Univariate hypothesis testing designs

**Deliverable:** AME 2 — univariate model + diagnostic + decision log

---

## Week 3 (Jan 26): Landmarks, Procrustes, and the geometry of form
**Topics**
- Landmarks/semilandmarks; sliding
- GPA, centroid size, tangent space
- Deformation visualization (TPS grids, vectors)

**Deliverable:** AME 3: PCA + deformation figure + biological claim

---

## Week 4 (Feb 2): Outlines + Fourier descriptors
**Topics**
- When landmarks fail: outlines and complex boundaries
- Elliptic Fourier descriptors; reconstruction + harmonics
- Biological examples: teeth, fins, leaves, shells

**Deliverable:** AME 4 — outline PCA + one classifier/clustering analysis

---

## Week 5 (Feb 9): From ordination to inference (multivariate thinking)
**Topics**
- PCA as a tool (and the limits of PC fishing)
- Effect sizes, resampling, cross-validation ideas
- Trajectories and modularity (conceptual + simple workflows)

**Deliverable:** AME 5 — group comparison + uncertainty summary

---

## Week 6 (Feb 16): Comparative methods I (univariate PCM, properly)
**Topics**
- Phylogenetic signal (conceptual)
- PGLS, phylogenetic ANOVA; model diagnostics
- Trait–environment association example

**Deliverable:** AME 6 — PGLS + “what would change my mind?” paragraph

---

## Week 7 (Feb 23): Comparative methods II (multivariate PCM + shape)
**Topics**
- mvPGLS, phylogenetic MANOVA, distance-based alternatives
- High-dimensional shape: RRPP logic; regularization concept
- Tree-linked visualization (evolutionary patterns)

**Deliverable:** AME 7 — multivariate PCM test + tree visualization

---

## Week 8 (Mar 9): Evolutionary models of shape (BM, OU, rates, disparity)
> **Spring recess is Mar 2–6**, so this week lands immediately after recess.

**Topics**
- BM vs OU intuition for shape data
- Rate heterogeneity + regime shifts (claims you can/can’t make)
- Disparity through time; clade comparisons

**Deliverable:** AME 8 — model comparison figure + limitations section

---

# Phase II: Independent project block (Weeks 9–13)

Your project must include:
1) a biological question,  
2) shape/trait data, and  
3) at least one explicit comparative/evolutionary component.

## Week 9 (Mar 16): Project scoping + proposal clinic
**In class**
- Idea triage: question → data → methods → feasible scope
- Repo hygiene for research projects

**Deliverable:** Proposal (1–2 pages) + project repo skeleton

---

## Week 10 (Mar 23): Data audit + measurement error / sampling plan
**In class**
- Data provenance, cleaning, missingness checks
- Measurement error plan (repeat digitizing, bootstrap, sensitivity)

**Deliverable:** Data audit notebook + updated README (data provenance)

---

## Week 11 (Mar 30): Analysis plan + prereg-style decision log
**In class**
- What’s confirmatory vs exploratory?
- Mapping hypotheses to models + plots

**Deliverable:** Analysis plan + decision log + figure mockups

---

## Week 12 (Apr 6): Midpoint check-in (one model, one figure, one claim)
> **Easter recess is Apr 2–6**; if your section meets early in the week, we’ll adjust check-ins.

**Deliverable:** Midpoint release (tagged) + short reflection

---

## Week 13 (Apr 13–Apr 27): Writing, polishing, and presenting
> **Patriot’s Day is Apr 20** (no classes) and may affect meeting patterns.

**Deliverables (end of window)**
- Final report (reproducible HTML + PDF)
- 10–12 minute presentation
- v1.0 tagged release + README + CITATION

---
