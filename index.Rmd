title: "BIOL 5410: Research in Comparative Shape Analysis"
---

# Welcome

Welcome to **Comparative Shape Analysis**, a course focused on understanding **biological form through real organisms, real data, and reproducible analysis**.

Organismal biology sits at the intersection of **form, function, ecology, and evolution**. In this course, we use biological examples---teeth, fins, skulls, wings, and bodies---to ask how shape varies, how it works, and how and why it evolves as it does. Along the way, students develop a practical toolkit for measuring, analyzing, and interpreting biological shape using modern quantitative methods.

This is a **code-driven, research-style course**. You will spend much of the semester working with data, writing analysis pipelines, and making decisions about models, assumptions, and interpretation—just as practicing biologists do.

# Course scope, goals, and objectives

To be an effective organismal biologist, one must be able to **translate
biological questions into quantitative analyses** and back again. That means understanding both *what tools exist* and *when they should (or should not) be used*.

The thrust of this course is to develop and hone **quantitative skills relevant to organismal and evolutionary biology**, with a particular emphasis on biological shape.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

  - Distinguish **shape, size, and form**, and articulate what each implies biologically  
  - Quantify **univariate characters** (e.g. lengths, ratios, scaling relationships)and evaluate their assumptions  
  - Analyze **multivariate and geometric morphometric data**, including landmark-and outline-based approaches 
  - Apply **phylogenetic comparative methods** to test evolutionary hypotheses about traits and shape
  - Diagnose common failure modes in biological data analysis (collinearity,overfitting, phylogenetic non-independence, etc.)  
  - Build **fully reproducible analysis workflows** using R, Git, and GitHub
  - Communicate results clearly using figures, code, and biological interpretation

# Course philosophy

This course emphasizes **how you think**, not just whether you get a particular answer.

Biological data are messy. Shape data are high-dimensional. Evolutionary models are imperfect. Learning to navigate these realities--by making assumptions explicit, testing alternatives, and recognizing limitation--is more important than producing a single “correct” result.

You will be evaluated as much on **reasoning, transparency, and reproducibility** as on statistical outcomes.

# Structure of the course

The semester is divided into two phases:

## Weeks 1–8: Biological examples & core methods

During the first half of the course, we work through a sequence of biological case studies that introduce:

- Univariate traits and scaling
- Linear multivariate morphometrics
- Landmark-based geometric morphometrics
- Outline-based shape analysis
- Hypothesis testing with shape
- Phylogenetic regression and signal
- Evolutionary models of trait evolution
- Multivariate comparative methods

Most weeks includes:

  1. A single lecture on Tuesday.
  2. An [**Analysis and Modeling Exercise (AME)**](AME_guidelines.html) that emphasizes biological interpretation alongside analysis. The goals and scope of each AME are introduced on Thursday during class.
  3. A [**Chalk Talk**](chalk.html), also on Thursday, where students lead discussions of important topics in shape analysis as interpreted through influential literation

## Weeks 9–13: Independent research project

In the second half of the semester, students conduct an **independent, reproducible research project** focused on biological shape. Projects will be original analyses of student-assembled datasets.

The projects culminate in:
- A fully reproducible GitHub repository
- An report with outlining the important findings and interpretations

---

# What this course is (and is not)

**This course is:**

- Quantitative and biological
- Code-centric and reproducible
- Focused on interpretation, not button-pushing
- Structured to resemble real research workflows

**This course is not:**
- A pure statistics course
- A software-tutorial class
- Focused on memorizing formulas
- Designed around artificial or “toy” datasets

---

# Tools and expectations

Students are expected to work regularly with:

- **R** for data analysis and visualization  
- **R Markdown** for clear, reproducible reports  
- **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration  

Prior experience with biological analysis in R is required (i.e., BIOL 3140) as is comfort with learning by
doing.

# Course Assessment

Your grade will be based on five assignment components: Asking and answering questions on our discussion board, many in-class coding exercises, and a series of project reports: 4 for Phase I projects, 4 for Phase II projects, and one for the Phase III project.

# Accommodation and Accessibility

Boston College is committed to providing accommodations to students, faculty, staff and visitors with disabilities. Specific documentation from the appropriate office is required for students seeking accommodation in Woods College courses. Advanced notice and formal registration with the appropriate office is required to facilitate this process. There are two separate offices at BC that coordinate services for students with disabilities:

  + [The Connors Family Learning Center (CFLC)](http://www.bc.edu/libraries/help/tutoring.html) coordinates services for students with LD and ADHD.
  + [The Disabilities Services Office (DSO)](http://www.bc.edu/offices/dos/subsidiary_offices/disabilityservices.html) coordinates services for all other disabilities.

Find out more about BC’s commitment to accessibility at www.bc.edu/sites/accessibility.

# Scholarship and Academic Integrity

Students in this course, as all others at BC, must produce original work and cite references appropriately. Failure to cite references is plagiarism. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the *use of AI* (see below) to produce work a student claims as their own, plagiarism, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, cheating on exams or assignments, or submitting the same material or substantially similar material to meet the requirements of more than one course without seeking permission of all instructors concerned. Scholastic misconduct may also involve, but is not necessarily limited to, acts that violate the rights of other students, such as depriving another student of course materials or interfering with another student’s work. Please see the [Boston College policy on academic integrity](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/policies-procedures.html#academic_integrity_policies) for more information.

## Use of AI

Generative AI can be an incredibly powerful tool for anyone interested in writing a little code---you can ask it to do so much for you, and most of the time, what it produces works relatively well. Thus, it may be tempting for anyone new to modeling and data science to rely on this tool, in part or whole, for many of the assignments for this course. In your instructor's opinion, relying on AI would make the learning goals and objectives of the course hard to reach. His opinion is that it can be helpful, but can often stifle learning and be used irresponsibly. So that we're all on the same page with regard to how AI fits into the course, students should read, understand, and follow this AI policy.


### Requirements


  + All students must attribute AI as the source of any work (i.e., you must cite your AI sources and specifically how they were used). Therefore, there must be a statement in every piece of submitted work that outlines how AI was used in the execution of the project. 
  + Students may *NOT* submit AI-generated work as wholesale substitutes for the work expected of them. In other words, any work a student submits must be, by and large, produced by that student and not the direct output of AI. 
 

### Guidelines for Acceptable Use

  AI may be used for:
  
  + Brainstorming and  code-review preparation.
  + Debugging code and error interpretations.
  + Finding guidance concerning how to implement code in an analysis (e.g, appropriate functions, syntax, and logic).
  + Background research on a topic or quantitative method.
  + Generating a lists of potentially relevant sources to read.
  + Editing text for clarity, spelling and grammar.
  + Many other things.*
 
*If you come to a point where you're using AI and unsure if this particular use falls in the "acceptable" category, please talk with Prof. K. He'll provide some guidance.

### Penalties

Any work submitted that violates this policy will be considered a breach of [the University's broader policy on academic integrity](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/policies-procedures.html#academic_integrity_policies). Violations of the policy may incur penalties that include a grade of 0 for a violating assignment, a formal academic integrity inquiry, and/or failing grade for course.

# Email and Office Hours Policy

If you write Professor Kenaley with a question, he’ll try to get back to you within 24 hours. Rather than write Prof. Kenaley with questions related to course mechanics and expectations, please post these in our [discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/bcshape/discussions). It’s probably the case that others have the same questions.

Office hours can be arranged by appointment via email and will take in person (Higgins 425B). Office hours may involve more more than student or team, so please come equipped with poignant questions and expect that other students have questions as urgent as yours.
