This course is about how biological form varies,
why it varies, and how we can test ideas about that variation.

We'll combine:

  - shape
  - evolution
  - biomechanics and ecology
  - statistics

to study shape as data.

What is shape?

# What is shape?

.pull-left[

Not size alone

Not simple ratios

Not a picture with labels

Shape is:
  
  - geometry
  - covariance
  - constrained (development, physics)
  - product of evolutionary history

And it only makes sense to look at all this comparatively.

# What this course is not

.pull-left[

It isn't 

  - a software tutorial
  - analysis-for-its-own-sake class
  - a catalog of morphological novelty
]

.pull-right[
Instead, we’ll ask:

What questions require multivariate thinking?

What hypotheses are productive in understanding why shape evolves the way it does?

# Our focal study system


.pull-left[

Tetraodontiform fishes, A clade that includes:

  - pufferfishes
  - boxfishes
  - triggerfishes
  - filefishes-
  - ocean sunfishes

They are:

  - morphologically extreme
  - evolutionarily young but diverse (radiation)
  - functionally constrained
]

.pull-right[

If shape evolves due to function and history,
tetraodontiforms are a test case.

# Why tetraodontiforms?

.pull-left[

+ Enormous disparity from a relatively compact clade

+ Repeated departures from “typical” fish body plans

+ Clear links between:

  - shape
  - locomotion
  - defense
  - feeding
  
]


.pull-right[

This forces us to ask:

What counts as a meaningful axis of shape variation?

Do these axes of shape variation covary with any of these features?
