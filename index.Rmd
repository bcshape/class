title: "Comparative Shape Analysis"
output: html_document
---

Welcome to **Comparative Shape Analysis**, a course focused on understanding
**biological form through real organisms, real data, and reproducible analysis**.

Organismal biology sits at the intersection of **form, function, ecology, and
evolution**. In this course, we use biological examples—teeth, fins, skulls,
leaves, wings, and bodies—to ask how shape varies, how it works, and how it
evolves. Along the way, students develop a practical toolkit for measuring,
analyzing, and interpreting biological shape using modern quantitative methods.

This is a **code-driven, research-style course**. You will spend much of the
semester working with data, writing analysis pipelines, and making decisions
about models, assumptions, and interpretation—just as practicing biologists do.

# Course scope, goals, and objectives

To be an effective organismal biologist, one must be able to **translate
biological questions into quantitative analyses** and back again. That means
understanding both *what tools exist* and *when they should (or should not) be
used*.

The thrust of this course is to develop and hone **quantitative skills relevant
to organismal and evolutionary biology**, with a particular emphasis on
biological shape.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Distinguish **shape, size, and form**, and articulate what each implies
  biologically  
- Quantify **univariate characters** (e.g. lengths, ratios, scaling relationships)
  and evaluate their assumptions  
- Analyze **multivariate and geometric morphometric data**, including landmark-
  and outline-based approaches  
- Apply **phylogenetic comparative methods** to test evolutionary hypotheses
  about traits and shape  
- Diagnose common failure modes in biological data analysis (collinearity,
  overfitting, p ≫ n, phylogenetic non-independence)  
- Build **fully reproducible analysis workflows** using R, Git, and GitHub  
- Communicate results clearly using figures, code, and biological interpretation

# Course philosophy

This course emphasizes **how you think**, not just whether you get a particular
answer.

Biological data are messy. Shape data are high-dimensional. Evolutionary models
are imperfect. Learning to navigate these realities—by making assumptions
explicit, testing alternatives, and recognizing limitations—is more important
than producing a single “correct” result.

You will be evaluated as much on **reasoning, transparency, and reproducibility**
as on statistical outcomes.

# Structure of the course

The semester is divided into two phases:

## Weeks 1–8: Biological examples & core methods

During the first half of the course, we work through a sequence of biological
case studies that introduce:

- Univariate traits and scaling
- Linear multivariate morphometrics
- Landmark-based geometric morphometrics
- Outline-based shape analysis
- Hypothesis testing with shape
- Phylogenetic regression and signal
- Evolutionary models of trait evolution
- Multivariate comparative methods

Each week includes a **short, code-based lab notebook** that emphasizes
biological interpretation alongside analysis.

## Weeks 9–13: Independent research project

In the second half of the semester, students conduct an **independent,
reproducible research project** focused on biological shape.

Projects may be:
- Original analyses of instructor-provided or student-assembled datasets, or
- Replication-and-extension studies based on published work

All projects culminate in:
- A fully reproducible GitHub repository
- A project website page (GitHub Pages)
- A short oral presentation

# What this course is (and is not)

**This course is:**
- Quantitative and biological
- Code-centric and reproducible
- Focused on interpretation, not button-pushing
- Structured to resemble real research workflows

**This course is not:**
- A pure statistics course
- A software-tutorial class
- Focused on memorizing formulas
- Designed around artificial or “toy” datasets

---

# Tools and expectations

Students are expected to work regularly with:

- **R** for data analysis and visualization  
- **R Markdown** for clear, reproducible reports  
- **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration  

Prior experience with biological analysis in R is required (i.e., BIOL 3140) as is comfort with learning by
doing.

---

# Accessibility, collaboration, and integrity

Collaboration is encouraged at the **conceptual level**—discussing biological
ideas, interpreting figures, and debugging logic.

All submitted work must represent **your own analysis and writing**, and all
code must be clearly attributed when reused or adapted.

If you have accessibility needs or concerns, please contact the instructor
early so accommodations can be arranged.
