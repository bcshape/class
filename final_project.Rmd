title: "Final Project"
---

<!-- The last 5 weeks of the course is devoted to a single team-based independent project that combines the conceptual knowledge from lecture and AME exercises to answer a shape evolution question. Two teams will work on separate questions using data the collect. -->

<!-- A report and short presentation. -->

<!-- # Project Guidelines -->

<!-- ## General Advice -->

<!-- The most important point to consider while undertaking your FP is this: pose an informed question (i.e., an hypothesis) and address it quantitatively with the data you collect. Beyond this, you must also explain why you asked the question you have, that is, establish what about this question is relevant about to the biology and physics underlying your hypothesis. To successfully pose a manageable question and realize its importance, it is critical to choose a topic or problem that is tidy and focused. In doing so, you can address it in enough detail in your report and presentation. -->

<!-- To understand what is important about your question and, just as importantly, establish how you'll get your data (i.e., design your experiment), you must evaluate how similar questions have been answered and what the answers were. In other words, you must review the literature. The introductory and discussion material of your reports and presentations should include information gathered from the literature that address why the work is important and how your work contributes to new knowledge. Prof. K will work with you to review the appropriate literature. -->

<!-- Once you have a good idea of how to approach your problem and in what context it might land, you're now ready to do some science. Your experimental subjects need not be human, but they must permit easy data acquisition---you only have a few days to collect these. Experiments should leverage the skills and technical knowledge you obtained in class, including biomechanical modeling in R, kinematic analysis in imageJ, and data acquisition with Arduino. Of course, critical to your choice of methodologies is the instrumentation you can access: wind tunnel, three-point tester, force transducers, calipers, iPhones and all the software used with these. In choosing what instrumentation and software to use, you must understand what data you want to gather. Therein, as the Bard would say, lies the rub. Think critically about this and consider how your data will perform in answering your question. A list of resources available to you can be found [**here**](5380.resources.pdf). -->

<!-- ## Project Timeline -->

<!-- We'll break from lecture activities in late April to begin thinking about the final project. On Wednesday, April 21st, and Friday, April 23rd, we'll hold a round table to discuss potential projects, including their scope and logistics. After this, you'll have approximately three weeks to complete the project and submit your presentation and another week after that to complete and submit the project report. Please have a look at our [schedule](schedule.html) page for more details. -->

<!-- After the round tables, each team will be required to schedule at least one meeting with Prof. K to discuss relevant literature and perhaps collaborate on experiments. -->


<!-- # Final Project Report -->

<!-- ## Report Guidelines -->

<!-- Just like the MPs, the Final Project report should resemble a short manuscript that models a scientific paper. By this, we mean that it should contain appropriate headings or sections framing the question, how it was answered, the results, and how these results relate to the question and similar work that has been done. Like the [MP reports](mini_projects.html#ReportGuidelines), these sections include:  -->

<!--   + Introduction: One or two paragraphs that proclaim the motivation for the work and prepares readers for the structure and outcomes described in the report. -->
<!--   + Methods: One or two paragraphs that detail how the question was answered and how one could reproduce the experiments presented in the report. -->
<!--   + Results: One or two paragraphs that summarize the results. This section should reference at least one figure produced through your analysis in R. -->
<!--   + Discussion: Once or two paragraphs that briefly discuss the importance of the results (i.e., how they relate to the main question and the field in a broader context). -->
<!--   + Author Contributions: A paragraph that briefly state the contributions made by each team member to the project. -->
<!--   + References: A bibliography section that includes the works cited in the text. -->

<!-- Please synthesize your results into a report 5 pages long using R markdown. Each group should submit on document containing the markdown code and a second document rendered in R markdown. These should be emailed to Professor Kenaley. The R markdown document should look something like a scientific paper, perhaps like one you read in your literature review. It should include the following sections and their associated content: -->

<!-- The very prestigious Nature publishing group has released a series of articles on their "Scitable" site devoted to writing in science. You may find [this article](https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/118519636#bookContentViewAreaDivID) helpful in writing your report. -->

<!-- ## Author Contribution Evaluations -->

<!-- As with the mini-projects, **EVERY** group member of each team must submit an evaluation of their teammates' contributions to the final project. These evaluations can be made using [this form](https://forms.gle/1CMXtch2feruGxoX9).  -->

<!-- ## Writing Advice -->

<!-- Like with the MPs, you may find [this article](https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/118519636#bookContentViewAreaDivID) helpful in writing your FP report. Likewise, advice concerning [how to avoid common writing mistakes]Common_mistakes.pdf)) may also be helpful.  -->

<!-- # Final Project Presentation -->

<!-- Each team will make a 10-minute presentation using the software of their choice. The content of the presentation should be a distillation of project paper, however, it should be visually pleasing and not just a bunch of text.  More specific guidelines and advice for composing the presentation can be found at this nifty [post on Nature's Scitable site](https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/118520778/). -->

<!-- The presentation should include 8 minutes for sharing your project and 2 minutes for questions. This time allotment will be strictly enforced. Each member of your group must present at least one slide. Questions will be addressed to the group as a whole. -->

<!-- ## Presentation Guidelines -->

<!-- The presentation should be [recorded in Zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZHSAMd89JE) or some other software that can record video and a screen simultaneously. Each team member should record their part of the presentation for the team to [assemble into the final presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTTDR8nEncY). Presentations should be uploaded to this directory with a file name in the following format "TEAMNAME_final_presentation.mp4".  -->

<!-- The class will convene at Prof. K's home at some point over finals period to watch the pre-recorded presentations and ask questions of each team.  -->

<!-- ## Presentation Rubric -->
